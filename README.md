# Prework-Study-Guide
A study guide for course prework 
- My motivation for building this project was to sharpen my skills and improve as a coder.
- I built this project so it can be helpful for someone who is doesn't have much knowledge when it comes to coding so they can use this as a starting point.
- This study guide instructs the coder on different areas and fundamentals that you have to know when you're coding and it can also help them avoid small mistakes that are bound to happen.
- I learned a lot in this project, coding is a very precise thing that has to be looked at thoroughly and examined by more than one set of eyes and the smallest thing can cause a bug.

This study guide can be used to sharpen your knowledge about various topics in coding specifically HTML, CSS, Javascript, and GIT. This study guide has four seperate sections that contains notes on each one of these topics from learning how each of these has their own seperate jobs when it pertains to the code and the key terms that coincide with the topics. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
